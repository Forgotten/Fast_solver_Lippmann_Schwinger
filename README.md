Fast Solver for the Lipmmann-Schwinger equation

This is a very experimental implementation for a fast solver for the Lippmann-Schwinger equation based on the the method of polarized traces and the sparsifying preconditioner which is explaines in Zepeda-Nunez and Zhao "Fast alternating bi-directional preconditioner for the 2D high-frequency Lippmann-Schwinger equation."
